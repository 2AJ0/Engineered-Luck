🎲 Engineered Luck

An adaptive probability game that explores how systems can subtly influence outcomes.

⸻

📌 Overview

Engineered Luck is a terminal-based interactive game written in Python.

At first glance, it appears to be a simple number-guessing game.
However, beneath the surface, the system dynamically adjusts probabilities based on player behavior, betting patterns, and engagement signals.

The goal is not just to win — but to observe how the system reacts.

⸻

🎮 How It Works
	•	The player guesses a number between 1–10
	•	Places a virtual bet
	•	The system calculates an outcome
	•	Behavioral data is tracked silently
	•	Probability subtly adapts over time
	•	A mid-game reveal exposes the engineered nature of the system

The experience is designed to:
	•	Feel fair initially
	•	Introduce subtle suspicion
	•	Deliver a structured reveal
	•	Shift tone dynamically

🧠 Core Technical Features

1️⃣ Adaptive Probability Engine

Win probability adjusts based on:
	•	Repeated guess patterns
	•	Bet escalation
	•	Win/loss streaks
	•	Behavioral signals

⸻

2️⃣ Suspicion Tracking System

An internal suspicion meter builds when:
	•	Near-misses occur
	•	Consecutive losses stack
	•	High-risk behavior is detected

This enables a dramatic reveal moment triggered by player experience.

⸻

3️⃣ Pattern Recognition

The system tracks:
	•	Guess history (rolling window)
	•	Repetition frequency
	•	Switching behavior after losses
	•	Bet history

Dealer responses adapt accordingly.

4️⃣ Dramatic Reveal Mechanic

A near-miss event after sufficient suspicion triggers a narrative shift, explicitly revealing the manipulation behind the scenes.

⚙️ Tech Stack
	•	Python 3
	•	Standard Library only
	•	Stateful loop-based architecture
	•	No external dependencies

⸻
🏗 Architecture (v0.1)

Single-file prototype containing:
	•	Core gameplay loop
	•	Probability engine
	•	Suspicion system
	•	Reveal trigger logic
	•	Dealer dialogue controller
	•	State management

Future versions will modularize the architecture for web and app deployment.
